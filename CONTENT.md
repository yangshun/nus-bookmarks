NUS Bookmarks
==
****

NUS Bookmarks is a collection of resources that will be useful to most NUS students regarding curriculum and some of the special programmes such as NOC (NUS Overseas Colleges). The initial version of this resource list will have a focus on Engineering and Computer Science-related students simply because of the background of the creators. We would also like to extend the list of resources to cover other faculties. Contributions are welcome! 



CORS and Module Planning
-- 

- [**NUSMods**](http://www.nusmods.com): A web-based timetable planner that helps you find modules which fit your schedule, plan your ideal timetable, then share it with your friends or export it to various formats.
- [**Corspedia**](http://www.corspedia.com): An easy-to-use search engine for NUS CORS Bidding Archives.
- [**Module Review**](http://module-review.com/): A community-driven platform where reviews from seniors who have taken the modules are being shared. This allows students to learn more about modules as they make more informed decisions during module selections.
